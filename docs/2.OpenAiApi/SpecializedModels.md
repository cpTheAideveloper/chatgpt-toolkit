```

## Integration Best Practices

### Model Selection Strategy

1. **Start with specialized models** for specific tasks:
   - Transcription → GPT-4o Transcribe
   - Embeddings → text-embedding-3-small
   - Image generation → DALL·E 3
   - Real-time voice → Realtime API with GPT-4o mini

2. **Consider hybrid approaches**:
   - Use embeddings + GPT-4.1 nano for RAG applications
   - Combine vision capabilities with language processing
   - Pre-process with specialized models before sending to generative models

### Performance Optimization

1. **Caching strategies**:
   - Cache embedding vectors for frequent queries
   - Store generated images and transcriptions
   - Implement result caching for repetitive requests

2. **Batch processing where possible**:
   - Combine multiple embedding requests
   - Process audio files in batches during off-peak times
   - Generate related images in parallel

### Cost Management

1. **Model right-sizing**:
   - Use smaller models for development and testing
   - Reserve premium models for production or critical tasks
   - Scale model selection based on complexity of the task

2. **Input optimization**:
   - Trim unnecessary context for shorter inputs
   - Compress or downsample media files when quality isn't critical
   - Use cached responses for identical requests

## Conclusion

OpenAI's specialized models offer powerful capabilities beyond general language processing. By understanding the strengths and optimal use cases for each model, you can build sophisticated applications that leverage the right tool for each task.
