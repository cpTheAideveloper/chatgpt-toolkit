### Overview
The `useFileManager` hook manages the state of a selected file and interacts with different modes of your application (like normal mode or file mode). It ensures that when a file is selected, the application switches to file mode, and when the file is cleared, it reverts to normal mode.

### Complete Code for Reference

```javascript
// src/hooks/useFileManager.js
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { MODES } from "../constants/chatConstants"; // Import MODES

// Needs access to setActiveMode from useModeManager
export const useFileManager = (activeMode, setActiveMode) => {
  const [selectedFile, setSelectedFile] = useState(null);

  // Set the file mode when a file is selected
  useEffect(() => {
    if (selectedFile) {
      setActiveMode(MODES.FILE);
    } else if (activeMode === MODES.FILE) {
      // If file is cleared and we were in file mode, go back to normal
      setActiveMode(MODES.NORMAL);
    }
    // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
  }, [selectedFile, setActiveMode]); // Dependency on activeMode removed to avoid loop, handled logic internally

  const clearSelectedFile = () => {
    setSelectedFile(null);
    // When clearing file, return to normal mode only if current mode IS file mode
    if (activeMode === MODES.FILE) {
      setActiveMode(MODES.NORMAL);
    }
  };

  return {
    selectedFile,
    setSelectedFile,
    clearSelectedFile,
  };
};
```

### Line-by-Line Explanation

Let's go through the code line by line.

---

#### Lines 1-3: Importing Dependencies

```javascript
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { MODES } from "../constants/chatConstants"; // Import MODES
```

1. **`import { useState, useEffect } from "react";`**
   - **`useState`** and **`useEffect`** are **React Hooks**.
   - `useState` allows you to add state to a functional component.
   - `useEffect` lets you perform side effects in your components, such as fetching data or updating the DOM.

2. **`import { MODES } from "../constants/chatConstants";`**
   - This line imports a constant named `MODES` from a file located at `../constants/chatConstants`.
   - **`MODES`** likely contains different application modes, such as `FILE` and `NORMAL`.

---

#### Line 5: Comment Explaining Dependencies

```javascript
// Needs access to setActiveMode from useModeManager
```

- This comment indicates that the `useFileManager` hook requires access to a function named `setActiveMode`, which is probably provided by another hook called `useModeManager`.
- **`setActiveMode`** is used to change the current mode of the application.

---

#### Line 6: Defining the Custom Hook

```javascript
export const useFileManager = (activeMode, setActiveMode) => {
```

- **`export const useFileManager = (activeMode, setActiveMode) => {`**
  - This line declares and exports a new custom hook named `useFileManager`.
  - **Parameters:**
    - **`activeMode`**: Represents the current mode of the application (e.g., normal or file mode).
    - **`setActiveMode`**: A function to change the current mode.

---

#### Line 7: Initializing State

```javascript
  const [selectedFile, setSelectedFile] = useState(null);
```

- **`const [selectedFile, setSelectedFile] = useState(null);`**
  - **`selectedFile`**: Holds the currently selected file. Initially, it's set to `null`, meaning no file is selected.
  - **`setSelectedFile`**: A function to update the `selectedFile` state.
  - **`useState(null)`**: Initializes the state with `null`.

---

#### Lines 9-18: Managing Mode with `useEffect`

```javascript
  // Set the file mode when a file is selected
  useEffect(() => {
    if (selectedFile) {
      setActiveMode(MODES.FILE);
    } else if (activeMode === MODES.FILE) {
      // If file is cleared and we were in file mode, go back to normal
      setActiveMode(MODES.NORMAL);
    }
    // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
  }, [selectedFile, setActiveMode]); // Dependency on activeMode removed to avoid loop, handled logic internally
```

1. **Comment:**
   - Explains that this effect sets the mode to file mode when a file is selected.

2. **`useEffect(() => { ... }, [selectedFile, setActiveMode]);`**
   - **`useEffect`** runs the provided function whenever the dependencies (`selectedFile` or `setActiveMode`) change.
   - **Dependencies:**
     - **`selectedFile`**: The selected file state.
     - **`setActiveMode`**: The function to change the mode.

3. **Inside the `useEffect` function:**
   - **`if (selectedFile) { setActiveMode(MODES.FILE); }`**
     - If `selectedFile` is not `null` (a file is selected), switch the mode to `FILE` using `setActiveMode`.
   - **`else if (activeMode === MODES.FILE) { setActiveMode(MODES.NORMAL); }`**
     - If there is no `selectedFile` and the current mode is `FILE`, switch back to `NORMAL` mode.
   - This logic ensures that the application switches to file mode when a file is selected and reverts to normal mode when the file is cleared.

4. **Disabling ESLint Rule:**
   - **`// eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`**
     - This comment disables a specific ESLint rule for the next line.
     - **`react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`**: A rule that ensures all dependencies are specified correctly in the dependency array.
   - The rule is disabled here to prevent including `activeMode` as a dependency, which could cause unnecessary re-renders or loops.

5. **Dependency Array Comment:**
   - **`// Dependency on activeMode removed to avoid loop, handled logic internally`**
     - This explains why `activeMode` is not included in the dependency array.
     - Including it might cause the effect to run in an infinite loop, so the necessary logic is handled within the effect itself.

#### Lines 20-27: Clearing the Selected File

```javascript
  const clearSelectedFile = () => {
    setSelectedFile(null);
    // When clearing file, return to normal mode only if current mode IS file mode
    if (activeMode === MODES.FILE) {
      setActiveMode(MODES.NORMAL);
    }
  };
```

1. **`const clearSelectedFile = () => { ... };`**
   - This defines a function named `clearSelectedFile`.
   - **Purpose:** To clear the selected file and update the application mode accordingly.

2. **`setSelectedFile(null);`**
   - Sets `selectedFile` to `null`, effectively clearing any previously selected file.

3. **Comment:**
   - Explains that when a file is cleared, the mode should return to normal **only if** the current mode is file mode.

4. **`if (activeMode === MODES.FILE) { setActiveMode(MODES.NORMAL); }`**
   - Checks if the current mode is `FILE`.
   - If it is, it changes the mode back to `NORMAL` using `setActiveMode`.
   - This ensures that the application only switches back to normal mode if it was previously in file mode.

---

#### Lines 29-34: Returning Values from the Hook

```javascript
  return {
    selectedFile,
    setSelectedFile,
    clearSelectedFile,
  };
};
```

1. **`return { selectedFile, setSelectedFile, clearSelectedFile };`**
   - The hook returns an object containing:
     - **`selectedFile`**: The current selected file.
     - **`setSelectedFile`**: Function to update the selected file.
     - **`clearSelectedFile`**: Function to clear the selected file and update the mode.
   - By returning these values, other components or hooks can use them to manage file selection and application modes.

2. **Closing the Hook:**
   - The closing curly brace `}` ends the `useFileManager` function.

### How to Use `useFileManager` in a Component

Here's a simple example of how you might use the `useFileManager` hook within a React component.

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { useModeManager } from "../hooks/useModeManager"; // Hypothetical hook
import { useFileManager } from "../hooks/useFileManager";
import { MODES } from "../constants/chatConstants";

const FileUploader = () => {
  const { activeMode, setActiveMode } = useModeManager();
  const { selectedFile, setSelectedFile, clearSelectedFile } = useFileManager(activeMode, setActiveMode);

  const handleFileChange = (event) => {
    const file = event.target.files[0];
    setSelectedFile(file);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>File Uploader</h1>
      {activeMode === MODES.FILE && selectedFile ? (
        <div>
          <p>Selected File: {selectedFile.name}</p>
          <button onClick={clearSelectedFile}>Clear File</button>
        </div>
      ) : (
        <input type="file" onChange={handleFileChange} />
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default FileUploader;
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Imports:**
   - `useModeManager`: A hypothetical hook that provides `activeMode` and `setActiveMode`.
   - `useFileManager`: The custom hook we explained earlier.
   - `MODES`: Constants defining different modes.

2. **Using the Hook:**
   - Destructure `activeMode` and `setActiveMode` from `useModeManager`.
   - Destructure `selectedFile`, `setSelectedFile`, and `clearSelectedFile` from `useFileManager`, passing in `activeMode` and `setActiveMode`.

3. **Handling File Selection:**
   - `handleFileChange` updates the `selectedFile` state when a user selects a file.

4. **Rendering:**
   - If the mode is `FILE` and a file is selected, display the file name and a "Clear File" button.
   - Otherwise, display a file input to select a file.

This example demonstrates how `useFileManager` manages the selected file and interacts with the application's mode, ensuring that the UI reflects the current state appropriately.

### Summary

- **`useState`**: Manages local state in a functional component.
- **`useEffect`**: Executes side effects based on state or prop changes.
- **Custom Hooks**: Allow you to encapsulate and reuse stateful logic.
- **`useFileManager`**:
  - Manages the `selectedFile` state.
  - Switches the application mode to `FILE` when a file is selected.
  - Reverts to `NORMAL` mode when the file is cleared.
  - Provides functions to set and clear the selected file.

By understanding each part of the `useFileManager` hook, you can see how React hooks work together to manage state and side effects in a clean and reusable way.
